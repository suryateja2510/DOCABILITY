# Docability – Solution Architecture

## System Flow
1. **User uploads document** (PDF, Word, Text) via frontend (web interface).
2. **Backend (FastAPI)** receives the file and extracts raw text.
3. **AI Agent Orchestrator (local)** coordinates tasks through modular services:
   - Summarizer Service → generates concise summary.
   - Translator Service → converts text into multiple languages.
   - Text-to-Speech Service → produces audio narration.
4. **Processed results returned to frontend**:
   - Readable text summary.
   - Downloadable/viewable translations.
   - Playable audio narration.
5. **Local storage** ensures temporary document and output handling. 
   (Future: Azure Blob for scalable and secure storage).

## Components
- **Frontend**: React (document upload, result dashboard, audio player).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (routing, API endpoints, integration with AI agents).
- **Agent Services**: Modular tasks (summarization, translation, TTS) connected via MCP protocol.
- **Storage**: Local file system (future-ready for Azure Blob/SharePoint).
- **Models/AI**: Azure OpenAI / OpenAI API (future-ready for enterprise-scale).

## Scalability Potential
- Move from local-only to hybrid deployment with Azure AI Services.
- Multiple customers can reuse modular MCP agents across tasks (document translation, accessibility, knowledge management).
- Can integrate with enterprise document systems (SharePoint, OneDrive).

## Security & Responsible AI Alignment
- Local-first approach avoids unnecessary data sharing.
- Future cloud integration will use enterprise security (Azure AD, role-based access).
- Adheres to Accessibility (WCAG/ADA) and Privacy (GDPR, HIPAA where applicable).
